# Sieve of Eratosthenes: Prime Number Finder

## Overview
This repository provides modular and reusable implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in both Python and C++. The algorithm is efficient and calculates all prime numbers up to a given limit, with optimizations and modular functions for high reusability.

## Algorithm
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a number theory algorithm that iteratively marks multiples of each prime, starting from 2, to identify all primes up to a specified integer limit.

### Structure
Each implementation is broken down into independent functions for initialization, marking non-primes, and extracting primes for enhanced usability.
